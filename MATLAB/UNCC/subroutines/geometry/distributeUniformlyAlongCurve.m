function [xv, yv, prevPt] = distributeUniformlyAlongCurve(N,x,y)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Usage: [xv, yv, prevPt] = distributeUniformlyAlongCurve(N,x,y)
%
% Inputs
%   N : number of points to distribute
%   (x,y) : vectors defining the curve
%
% Output
%   (xv, yv) : vectors defining the distributed points 
%   prevPt : vector indicating the index of (x,y) that immediately
%            precedes each distributed point
